# Bass2017-PixelBasedClassifier
This is the comprehensive code for building detection from aerial images using a random-forest classifier.

The code is split into function files that perform various tasks (classification, feature extraction, data/file location, result generation and run initialization).

To run the program, run the "runObjectIdentification" file after ensuring that the training/testing images are in the correct folders and can be accessed by the data file.

After running, results with ROC/PR curves and confidence maps will be generated.
